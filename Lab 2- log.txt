Tuesday afternoon: -Lab 2 was first assigned, read the instructions, and started drafting
up plans for each webpage on the site. The latter of this sentence happened after a small
car accident.

-At night, I began looking up how to unlock expressJS in my node.js command prompt

Wednesday: -I had to attend a doctor's appoinment this morning, and Mom and I didn't get home
until just after 3PM due to the waiting and terrible traffic outside of the office.

-I created my github repository and started filling it in with the text documents depicting
my plans for my family pages and what the output should be like.

-I also created a sketch of the shared header but its on paper, and I could not photograph
and upload the image to my github repository despite my feelinf it to be crucial.

Thursday afternoon: -Attended a tutor session in K building to see if I can solve my problem
with getting expressJS and understanding the instructions.

-I learned and practiced a couple commands for the node.js command prompt prior to installing
express.js

-At home, I got some ideas and input from my parents about what I should write for the site,
and gave them Rich's example so they'd know what the concept is and how I would not give away
too much personal information. I jotted down their ideas on paper - pen for the sentences I
was going to keep, and pecil for the ones my parents and I weren't sure about or were most
likely to change before typing the final draft-.

-In chronological order, I followed my choice for the shared header text: I created Mom's page first,
Dad's page second, my page third, and Jeffrey's the fourth.

-Late at night, I committed at least five versions of each family page as I discovered typos and
syntax error, and had to think about how they looked on a public github repository; one or
two of my pages, including my Mom's, has seven commits of the same name that replaced
each other.

-I also tried a command that was supposed to give me access to express in the Node.js command prompt.
It was around 10 PM and there were some difficutlies and educational articles I had to read about.

-33 minutes before 11 PM EST*, I carefully copied and submitted the url link to my github repository
for lab2 on Blackboard to Mr. Freeman in case something went wrong while my computer was deactivated and updating.

-Friday: a quarter to 11, I resumed work and updating and uploading text documents for
my family pages, making sure the message was delivered, my link was submitted, and the coding
scheme made sense.

I'm including where the header and paragraph arrowheads are supposed to go
to the documents right now. Unfortunately, I could not gain access to express, Heroku or the
localhost prior to today.

-11:25 AM: I'm adding a log to support the long hours I spent working on this despite the car accident.

-I confirmed that Blackboard registered my submission properly, so I'm just adding and updating
files in my repository.

-12:10 PM: Did my final updates with optional description for the log and page layouts to show
the deep thought and planning that went into this lab. This will be my 18th commit for most of
the files while this log will be my third version of it.
