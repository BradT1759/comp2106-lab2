Notes: -the shared header is represented by the rectangular breaks and the two asterisks on
the top line, as each link to each family member's page is equally spaced and to be in the
same "box" or location on the page.

-The paragraph containing my brother's description will have a wrap-around format depending on
the size and magnification of the user's browser window.

-I've also positioned the paragraph bracket markers with the wrap-around format in mind.
